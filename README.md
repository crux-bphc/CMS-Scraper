# CMS-Scraper
A Python script that scrapes and rips all files, discussions from Moodle based Course Management System for BPHC.
This script has been tested for Sem II 2018-2019 and found to work. However, there will always be edge cases which will require correction each sem.

The entire backup can be found [here]( https://tinyurl.com/cms-backups)
